# Restaurant Guide

COMP3074 Mobile Application Development I · Fall 2026 · Group P12.

A Kotlin and Jetpack Compose Android app for saving restaurant details, finding saved restaurants and revisiting favourite places. The planned architecture is MVVM with Room/SQLite local storage and Google Maps integration.

## Current state

This initial commit provides a separate, buildable Android starter with the purple app theme and an empty Restaurant List screen. The connected Figma demo and current PNG wireframes are included as the UI reference. Restaurant CRUD, persistence, search/filter logic, maps, directions, email sharing and the remaining app screens are still to be implemented.

## Open and build

1. Clone this repository after accepting your GitHub invitation.
2. Open the repository folder in Android Studio and allow Gradle sync to finish.
3. Use JDK 17 or newer and install Android SDK Platform 37. The minimum supported Android version is API 24.
4. Run the `app` configuration on an emulator or Android device.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EdoiseO/COMP3074-RestaurantGuide.git
cd COMP3074-RestaurantGuide
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:lintDebug
```

The Gradle wrapper, AGP 9.4.1, Kotlin Compose plugin 2.2.10 and Compose BOM 2026.02.01 are pinned to the locally installed course-project tooling. Keep `local.properties`, API keys, signing keys, IDE metadata and generated build files out of Git. Google Maps keys have not been added.

## UI prototype milestone

The UI prototype milestone is due October 11, 2026 at 23:59 Toronto. Its saved official brief requires a GitHub repository link and a video explaining the design and application purpose. Creating this repository does not complete that milestone or submit anything to Brightspace.

Resolve the documented rating and phone-field decisions before building those features. Photos and visit notes are later design additions; see the design-decision record for how they relate to the proposal.
